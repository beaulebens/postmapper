# PostMapper
A quick experimental app that requests and maps posts from a WordPress.com blog.

# Run
`npm start`

Starts the local server, which will run at http://localhost:3000/

# Develop
Make changes to `main.js` in this directory, or `www/index.html`. Run `npm run-script bundle` to browserify-bundle things into `www/bundle.js`, then refresh your browser.
